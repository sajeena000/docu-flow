## Git Workflow
This project was developed using a professional **Feature-Branch Workflow**:
1. All features were developed on isolated branches (e.g., `feature/navigation`).
2. Changes were integrated into the `main` branch via **Pull Requests**.
3. Continuous deployment is handled via **GitHub Pages**.
